How I Built a Fully Automated Matrix + WhatsApp Bridge on Linode (Akamai) with Terraform & Ansible

1. Provisioning the Linode Server with Terraform
- Used Terraform to define and provision a Linode (Akamai) virtual server.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) ensures repeatable, version-controlled deployments.
- Example resources: main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf for server creation and configuration.

2. Deploying Matrix Synapse with Ansible & Docker
- Automated the installation and configuration of Matrix Synapse (the open-source Matrix homeserver) using Ansible.
- Deployed Synapse, Postgres (database), and Nginx (reverse proxy) as Docker containers for easy management and isolation.
- Allowed users to register and create their own Matrix accounts.

3. Fully Automated WhatsApp Bridge Setup
- Used Ansible to deploy the mautrix-whatsapp bridge as a Docker container.
- Automated the generation and synchronization of the bridge registration file between Synapse and the bridge.
- Ensured all configuration (including database, registration, and permissions) is handled by Ansible—no manual steps required.
- Users can now send and receive WhatsApp messages directly from their Matrix accounts.

4. End-to-End Automation & User Experience
- The entire process—from server provisioning to Matrix and WhatsApp bridge deployment—is fully automated.
- Users simply register on Matrix and can immediately link their WhatsApp accounts via the bridge bot.

- Terraform provisions the Linode server.
- Ansible automates Docker deployment of Synapse, mautrix-whatsapp, Postgres, and Nginx.
- Matrix clients connect to Synapse, which is bridged to WhatsApp via mautrix-whatsapp.

Key Takeaways
- Full automation from infrastructure to application layer.
- No manual config or file copying—everything is handled by code.
- Users can bridge their Matrix and WhatsApp accounts seamlessly.
